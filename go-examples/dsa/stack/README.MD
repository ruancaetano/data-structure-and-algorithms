# Stacks

A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of plates, etc.

LIFO is an abbreviation for last in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed last and the last element is processed first. And Stacks is a LIFO approach for processing data.
