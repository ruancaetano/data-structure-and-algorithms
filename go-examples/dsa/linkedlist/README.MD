# Linked list

Linked list is a Dynamic Data Structure. Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next (and previous on the doubly linked list) node which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

## Singly

A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional (head to tail) so your nodes only point to your successor.

## Doubly

A Doubly linked list is a type of linked list that is bidirectional (head to tail and tail to head) then their nodes point to both the successor and the predecessor.

## Circular list

The circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form a circle. In a circular linked list, the first node and the last node are connected to each other which forms a circle. There is no NULL at the end.
