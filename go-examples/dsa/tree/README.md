# Tree

A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.


## Types of tree

1. General tree: has no restriction on the number of nodes. It means that a parent node can have any number of child nodes.

2. Binary tree: A node of a binary tree can have a maximum of two child nodes.

3. Balanced tree: If the height of the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree is equal or differs at most by 1, the tree is known as a balanced tree.
   <br/><br />
4. Binary search tree: are used for various searching and sorting algorithms. The examples include AVL tree and red-black tree. It shows that the value of the left node is less than its parent, while the value of the right node is greater than its parent.
